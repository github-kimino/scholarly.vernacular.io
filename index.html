        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Scholarly articles are still primarily encoded as unstructured graphics formats in which
          most of the information initially created by research, or even just in the text, is lost.
          This was an acceptable, if deplorable, condition when viable alternatives did not seem
          possible, but document technology has today reached a level of maturity and universality
          that makes this situation no longer tenable. Information cannot be disseminated if it is
          destroyed before even having left its creator’s laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the New York Times, adding structured information to their recipes (instead
          of exposing simply as plain text) improved their discoverability to the point of producing
          an immediate rise of 52 percent in traffic (<a href="#ref-nyt"
          property="schema:citation">NYT, 2014</a>). At this point in time, cupcake recipes are
          reaping greater benefits from modern data format practices than the whole scientific
          endeavour.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not solely a loss for the high principles of knowledge sharing in science, it also
          has very immediate pragmatic consequences. Any tool, any service that tries to integrate
          with scholarly publishing has to spend the brunt of its complexity (or budget) extracting
          data the author would have willingly shared out of antiquated formats. This places
          stringent limits on the improvement of the scholarly toolbox, on the discoverability of
          scientific knowledge, and particularly on processes of meta-analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address these issues, we have followed an approach rooted in established best practices
          for the reuse of open, standard formats. The «HTML Vernacular» body of practice provides
          guidelines for the creation of domain-specific data formats that make use of HTML’s
          inherent extensibility (<a href="#ref-vernacular" property="schema:citation">Science.AI,
          2015b</a>). Using the vernacular foundation overlaid with «schema.org» metadata we have
          produced a format for the interchange of scholarly articles built on open standards, ready
          for all to use.
        </p>

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn id="scholarly-html">Scholarly HTML document</dfn> is a valid HTML document that
          follows some additional rules to specialised its meaning and make it predictable to
          processors wishing to produce or consume scholarly articles. These rules are outlined in
          the following sections.
        </p>
        <section id="file-headers">
          <h3>File &amp; Supporting Structure</h3>
          <p>
            The document must be encoded in UTF-8, and transmitted with a media type of
            <code>text/html</code>. It must feature a <code>DOCTYPE</code> as its preamble.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>head</code> element of the document must contain a
            <code class="language-html">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"></code> element (preferable as its
            first child) and a <code>title</code> element. All the other content of the
            <code>head</code> is ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>body</code> element must have a <code>prefix</code> attribute, which must
            declare the following mapping:
          </p>
          <table typeof="schema:Table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Prefix</th>
                <th>URL</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tr>
              <td>schema</td>
              <td>http://schema.org/</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>xsd</td>
              <td>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>sa</td>
              <td>https://ns.science.ai/</td>
            </tr>
            <caption>
              The list of mappings that must be declared by the <code>body</code> element.
            </caption>
          </table>
          <p>
            Having to declare prefixes is undoubtably an annoyance and it does hurt the human
            authorability of the format (since hand-creating a document essentially requires a
            boilerplate prefix declaration). This trade-off is made for several reasons. The most
            important motivation is that having predictable prefixes means that the content can be
            styled with CSS using reliable attribute selectors on the semantic information that
            describes the document’s structure. The alternative would be to use URLs everywhere,
            such that instead of <code>sa:Abstract</code> we would have
            <code>https://ns.science.ai/Abstract</code>; but in practice that approach is more
            painful since the content then becomes bloated with URLs that are longer than is
            comfortable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The RDFa content of the article must systematically make use of these prefixes when the
            values match their URLs as prefixes. Authors may declare other prefix-URL mappings in
            the <code>prefix</code> attribute of the <code>body</code> element (or
            <code>prefix</code> attributes elsewhere), including other prefixes mapping to the same
            URLs if needed, but inside of the article’s content these prefixes must be used for
            these URLs.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="article">
          <h3>Article Structure</h3>
          <p>
            The article content is everything that is contained inside the first
            <code>article</code> element in document order that has a
            <code>typeof="schema:ScholarlyArticle"</code>. Everything part of the <code>body</code>
            outside of that subtree is ignored. This enables publishers to surround the article
            content with any amount of supporting markup, for instance for headers, footers,
            or navigation, as well as to wrap the article inside arbitrary markup that may be
            needed for stylistic reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first element child of the <code>article</code> element must be an <code>h1</code>
            heading that serves as the primary title for the document. It may itself contain markup.
            The white-space-normalised text value of the <code>h1</code> must appear as a substring
            of the white-space-normalised text value of the <code>title</code> element. This ensures
            semantic alignment between the two, while enabling publishers to add their name to the
            <code>title</code> so as to identify themselves there alongside the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            The containers for authors, affiliations, and funding are not specified yet. There is
            an <a href="https://github.com/scienceai/scholarly.vernacular.io/issues">open issue</a>
            on this topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any children of <code>article</code> that are not <code>section</code> elements are
            ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>section</code> elements can be nested arbitrarily deep. Each
            <code>section</code> element must have as its first element child an <code>hX</code>
            heading element the numeric part of which must be the number of <code>section</code>
            ancestor elements that heading elements has up to the <code>article</code> element, plus
            one. If the numeric part is greater than 6, then <code>h6</code> must be used but an
            <code>aria-level</code> attribute must be added that reflects the accurate depth.
            (The <code>aria-level</code> attribute can be used at lower depths but is not required
            there.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Each <code>section</code> element may contain an arbitrary number of
            <a href="#hunk-elements">hunk elements</a>, followed by an arbitrary number of
            <code>section</code> elements being subsections. Note that
            <a href="#hunk-elements">hunk elements</a> must imperatively appear <em>before</em> the
            subsections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sections are expected to be typed using the <code>typeof</code> attribute. The following
            <code>typeof</code> values are currently understood:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>sa:Abstract</code></li>
            <li><code>sa:MaterialsAndMethods</code></li>
            <li><code>sa:Results</code></li>
            <li><code>sa:Conclusion</code></li>
            <li><code>sa:Acknowledgements</code></li>
            <li><code>sa:ReferenceList</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Hopefully these types are largely self-documenting, they are described further in the
            Scholarly Article ontology
            (<a href="#ref-sa-ontology" property="schema:citation">Science.AI, 2015a</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The section typed sa:ReferenceList has special processing rules described in the
            <a href="#references-section">References section</a>.
